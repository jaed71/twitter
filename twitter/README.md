This is the mini twitter project using Laravel.
In this project I have implemented the functionalities of posting in tweets, updating tweets, deleting tweets and commenting on the tweets. It also has a search option that searches for specific word in the tweets. It has done for one user. There is no functionalities of following or log in.
